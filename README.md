PHP Engineer Challenge
=================================================


The purpose of this challenge is to understand how you use PHP.


Console Script
-------------------


Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a open source continuous integration server.


Create a script, in PHP, that uses Jenkins' API to get a list of jobs and their status from a given jenkins instance. The status for each job should be stored in an sqlite database along with the time for when it was checked.



Full App
-----------


Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). 


  a) Has welcome page in http://localhost/ 
      - this page has links to list and create functions
  b) Lists all stored names / email address in http://localhost/list
  c) Adds a name / email address to the database in http://localhost/add
      - should validate input and show errors


Since youâ€™re doing an application in make sure the app does not have major security problems: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection.
    
Make reasonable assumptions, state your assumptions, and proceed. Once you 
have completed the challenge let us know and share your thoughts on the 
problems/solutions.
Good luck!
